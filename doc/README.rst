A Python code for population synthesis of protoplanetary discs
===============================================================


Diskpop is a Python code used to generate and evolve synthetic populations of protoplanetary discs. It includes the viscous, hybrid and MHD-wind driven accretion prescriptions, internal and external photoevaporation, as well as dust evolution.

To analyse the raw output of Diskpop, the Python library popcorn is available. Both codes have been published in Somigliana et al. 2024 (ADD LINK).


Using Diskpop for your work
-----------------------------

Diskpop and popcorn are freely available for the community to use. If you use Diskpop simulations in your work, please make sure to cite Somigliana et al. (2024) ADD LINK. Additionally, as the dust evolution module is forked from Richard Booth's repository, if you use include dust in your simulations please cite also `Booth et al. (2017) <https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2017MNRAS.469.3994B/abstract>`_.


Installation
-------------

Diskpop can be installed from terminal as

.. code-block :: bash

	pip install diskpop

Alternatively, it is also possible to clone the Bitbucket repository.
In both cases, the installation of Diskpop automatically includes the output analysis library popcorn.


Diskpop Team
-------------

Diskpop and popcorn have been developed by Alice Somigliana, Giovanni Rosotti, Marco Tazzari, Leonardo Testi, Giuseppe Lodato, 
Claudia Toci, Rossella Anania, and Benoît Tabone. Both codes are under active development.
